# Netflix Clone


I've developed a simple clone of Netflix web application to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates Netflix's user interface, allowing users to browse a curated selection of movies. 

## Key features include:

- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.

- **Navigation Bar:** Features a logo and user profile section, similar to Netflix's interface.

- **Movie Grid Layout:** Displays movie posters in an organized grid, complete with hover effects for an interactive user experience.

- **Footer Section:** Includes relevant links, maintaining consistency with Netflix's design.

This project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of front-end development and responsive web design.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
